# Support Ticket Classification System (Task 2)

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning model that automatically classifies customer support tickets and assigns priority levels such as High, Medium, or Low.

## Problem Statement

Support teams receive many customer tickets daily. This system helps automatically classify tickets based on their content, improving response time and efficiency.

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* CountVectorizer (Text Feature Extraction)
* Multinomial Naive Bayes (Classification Algorithm)

## Project Files

* task2.py → Python source code
* output.txt → Model prediction output
* README.md → Project documentation

## How it Works

1. Input support ticket text
2. Convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer
3. Train classification model using Naive Bayes algorithm
4. Predict priority level of new support tickets

## Example Output

Prediction: High

## Skills Gained

* Text preprocessing
* Machine Learning classification
* Natural Language Processing basics
* Model training and prediction

## Conclusion

This system successfully classifies support tickets automatically and helps support teams respond faster and more efficiently.
